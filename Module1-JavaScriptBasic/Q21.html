    looping structures are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    
    JavaScript provides several types of loops
    for Loop: Ideal for a known number of iterations.
    while Loop: Executes as long as a condition is true.
    do...while Loop: Executes at least once and then checks the condition.
    for...in Loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.
    for...of Loop: Iterates over the values of an iterable object.

        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
