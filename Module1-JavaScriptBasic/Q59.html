    DOM (Document Object Model)

    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML
    or XML document as a tree of objects. Each node in the tree corresponds to a part of the document (e.g., elements,
    attributes, text content).
    Key Features of DOM

    Tree Structure: The document is represented as a hierarchical tree where each node is an object.
    Standardized by W3C: The DOM is a standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring consistency
    across different browsers.
    Manipulation: JavaScript can interact with and manipulate the DOM to change the structure, style, and content of the
    document dynamically.

    Common DOM Methods and Properties

    Selecting Elements:
    document.getElementById(id): Selects an element by its ID.
    document.getElementsByClassName(className): Selects elements by their class name.
    document.getElementsByTagName(tagName): Selects elements by their tag name.
    document.querySelector(selector): Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
    document.querySelectorAll(selector): Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

    Manipulating Elements:
    element.innerHTML: Gets or sets the HTML content of an element.
    element.textContent: Gets or sets the text content of an element.
    element.setAttribute(attr, value): Sets an attribute on an element.
    element.classList.add(className): Adds a class to an element.
    element.classList.remove(className): Removes a class from an element.
    element.appendChild(node): Adds a new child node to an element.

    BOM (Browser Object Model)

    The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of objects provided by the browser that allow interaction with the
    browser window and its components. Unlike the DOM, the BOM is not standardized and can vary between different
    browsers.
    Key Features of BOM

    Window Object: The window object is the top-level object in the BOM. It represents the browser window or tab and
    provides methods and properties to interact with the browser.
    Browser Control: BOM allows for control and interaction with browser features like navigation, display, and history.
    Non-Standardized: Since the BOM is not standardized, its implementation may vary across different browsers.

    Common BOM Methods and Properties

    Window Object:
    window.open(url, target): Opens a new browser window or tab.
    window.close(): Closes the current window.
    window.alert(message): Displays an alert dialog with a message.
    window.confirm(message): Displays a confirmation dialog with a message.
    window.prompt(message, default): Displays a prompt dialog to take input from the user.

    Navigator Object:
    navigator.userAgent: Returns the user-agent string for the browser.
    navigator.language: Returns the language of the browser.

    Location Object:
    location.href: Gets or sets the URL of the current page.
    location.reload(): Reloads the current page.
    location.assign(url): Loads a new document.

    History Object:
    history.back(): Loads the previous URL in the history list.
    history.forward(): Loads the next URL in the history list.
    history.go(delta): Loads a specific URL from the history list.
