    Arrays

    Structure:
    Arrays are ordered collections of data, indexed by numbers starting from 0.
    Each element in an array can be accessed using its numeric index.

    Use Cases:
    Arrays are typically used to store lists of items, especially when the order of items is important.
    Common examples include lists of numbers, strings, or objects.

    Syntax:
    Arrays are created using square brackets [].

    Properties and Methods:
    Arrays have built-in methods for manipulating their elements, such as push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(),
    slice(), forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), etc.
    The length of an array can be accessed using the length property.

    Example:

    let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
    console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
    fruits.push('date'); // Adds 'date' to the end of the array
    console.log(fruits); // Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

    Objects

    Structure:
    Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be any data type.
    Each value in an object is accessed using its associated key.

    Use Cases:
    Objects are typically used to represent more complex entities with properties and methods.
    Common examples include storing related data and methods for a single entity (like a user, product, or configuration
    settings).

    Syntax:
    Objects are created using curly braces {}.

    Properties and Methods:
    Object properties can be added, modified, or deleted using either dot notation or bracket notation.
    Objects do not have built-in methods for iteration, but they can be iterated using for...in loops or methods from
    Object like Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().

    Example:

    let person = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
    }
    };
    console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
    person.age = 31; // Modify the age property
    person.greet(); // Output: Hello, Alice

    Key Differences

    Indexing vs. Key-Value Pair:
    Arrays use numeric indexing (array[0], array[1], etc.).
    Objects use named keys (object.key, object['key']).

    Order:
    Arrays maintain the order of elements.
    Objects do not guarantee the order of properties, although in practice, most JavaScript engines iterate properties
    in the order they were added (with some exceptions for numeric keys).

    Iteration:
    Arrays can be iterated using loops (for, for...of, forEach, etc.).
    Objects are typically iterated using for...in loops or Object methods (Object.keys(), Object.values(),
    Object.entries()).

    Length Property:
    Arrays have a length property that gives the number of elements.
    Objects do not have a length property, but the number of properties can be determined using Object.keys(obj).length.

    Methods and Functionality:
    Arrays come with a wide range of built-in methods for manipulating the list of items.
    Objects do not have such built-in methods, but can hold functions as properties (methods).

    When to Use Each

    Use Arrays:
    When you need an ordered list of items.
    When you need to frequently add, remove, or access items by their position.

    Use Objects:
    When you need to represent a collection of key-value pairs.
    When you need to describe an entity with multiple properties and behaviors.
